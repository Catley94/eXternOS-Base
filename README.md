# eXternOS-Base


(Work in progress in terms of adding the files from the filesystem.)

This repository containts the filesystem base as it comes in the releases of eXtern OS. That includes everything that's compiled for distribution. To make things easier to manage, I have decided to seperate each of the Apps etc into their own repositories. That way any issues etc will be reported directly to the repository of that App or component. Once a release is ready the Apps and component resources are then updated here. Check the other repostories for the corresponding Apps' source code.
