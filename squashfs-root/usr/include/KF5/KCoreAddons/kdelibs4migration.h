/**
  * @class Kdelibs4Migration kdelibs4migration.h Kdelibs4Migration
  *
  * Kdelibs4Migration provides support for locating config files
  * and application data files saved by kdelibs 4 in the user's home directory
  * ($KDEHOME, i.e. typically ~/.kde).
  *
  * Distributions that built kdelibs4 with a custom KDE home with
  * the CMake option _KDE_DEFAULT_HOME_POSTFIX should use the same option
  * here with _KDE4_DEFAULT_HOME_POSTFIX
  *
  * The purpose is to be able to let the application migrate these files
  * to the KF5/Qt5 location for these files (QStandardPaths).
  *
  * Files from the "config" resource (as saved by KConfig) should be migrated to
  * QStandardPaths::writableLocation(QStandardPaths::ConfigLocation)
  *
  * Files from the "data" resource should be migrated to a subdirectory of
  * QStandardPaths::writableLocation(QStandardPaths::DataLocation)
  *
  * The following resources are supported:
   <ul>
   <li>config</li>
   <li>data</li>
   <li>services</li>
   <li>servicetypes</li>
   <li>wallpaper</li>
   <li>emoticons</li>
   <li>templates</li>
   </ul>
  * Use kdeHome() for anything else.
  *
  * @short Class for migration of config files from kdelibs4
  * @since 5.0
