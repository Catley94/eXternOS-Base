Package: debhelper
Description-md5: c3d35229c1ce392f77324206e097b92e
Description-en: helper programs for debian/rules
 A collection of programs that can be used in a debian/rules file to
 automate common tasks related to building Debian packages. Programs
 are included to install various files into your package, compress
 files, fix file permissions, integrate your package with the Debian
 menu system, debconf, doc-base, etc. Most Debian packages use debhelper
 as part of their build process.

Package: dh-autoreconf
Description-md5: 64431da0ae4318a5fbf441743bd5ffc5
Description-en: debhelper add-on to call autoreconf and clean up after the build
 dh-autoreconf provides a debhelper sequence addon named 'autoreconf' and two
 commands, dh_autoreconf and dh_autoreconf_clean.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf command creates a list of the files and their checksums,
 calls autoreconf and then creates a second list for the new files.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf_clean command compares these two lists and removes all
 files which have been added or changed (files may be excluded if needed).
 .
 For CDBS users, a rule is provided to call the dh-autoreconf programs at
 the right time.

Package: init-system-helpers
Description-md5: facafbf6c4b9fd95c34e95938629ecef
Description-en: helper tools for all init systems
 This package contains helper tools that are necessary for switching between
 the various init systems that Debian contains (e. g. sysvinit or
 systemd). An example is deb-systemd-helper, a script that enables systemd unit
 files without depending on a running systemd.
 .
 It also includes the "service", "invoke-rc.d", and "update-rc.d" scripts which
 provide an abstraction for enabling, disabling, starting, and stopping
 services for all supported Debian init systems as specified by the policy.
 .
 While this package is maintained by pkg-systemd-maintainers, it is NOT
 specific to systemd at all. Maintainers of other init systems are welcome to
 include their helpers in this package.

 to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and
